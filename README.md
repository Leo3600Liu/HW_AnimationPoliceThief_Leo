# HW_AnimationPoliceThief_Leo

My project does two moving people. The one person is only a picture, the other one is an animation.
The picture person will always follow the mouse, and the animation person will move away when the picture person touch him.
When people hit the "z" keyboard, the animation, which is a running person, will stop.
When people hit the "x" keyboard, it will take a screen shot.
